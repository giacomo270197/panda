# PANDA

Panda is a programming language created with Windows shellcode in mind. The compiler builds a completely position independent assembly which is then assembled with Keystone engine. The language is strongly typed, but type checking is quite relaxed and allows for a high degree of flexibility needed for shellcode development. The syntax is in general similar to C and Go. The idea for the language was inspired by the OSED course I recently took. I wanted to develop a way to write custom shellcode that would not require the user to write Assembly directly and bother with shellcode specific programming techniques.
